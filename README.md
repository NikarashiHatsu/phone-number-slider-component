Component Idea: Phone Number Slider

So the idea is, never let your client spent a little amount of time
either in the login page or in the register page. Make sure they are
having a good experience by having a little fun sliding those
component.

User will spent approximately more than one hour to get their phone
number correctly in place. To make it even better, make sure you have
"required" attribute on both of the inputs.
